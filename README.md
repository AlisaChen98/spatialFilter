# spatialFilter
Multiple spatial filter for image processing.

You can use the project to do some awesome filter work.

Develpo with Qt Creator.

## My goal
* Image browser that can 
  * open and display images in common formats, drag and drop images by dragging and scrolling, adaption for image size and position, complete image switching in the same directory, and complete image storage. Features
The basic operations of image grayscale transformation can be completed, including color image conversion to grayscale image, image inversion, logarithmic transformation, contrast stretching, grayscale histogram equalization, color histogram equalization, and histogram equalization based on HIS color space.
Basic operations for image spatial filtering, including linear filtering based on arbitrary filters, Gaussian filtering, bilateral filtering, median filtering, corrosion, and expansion
Can perform affine transformation of images
The frequency domain transformation of the image can be completed, including Fourier transform, low pass filtering and high pass filtering on the image.
